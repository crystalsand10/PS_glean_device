Model of the deivce and user of a GP system in order to study its usablity.


* PatientSafety_v1.gomsl - basic model for initial device testing. 
* PatientSafety_v2.gomsl - model for testing of Non - drug allergy option
* PatientSafety_v3.gomsl - model for testing of Class allergy. (Can be substituted with Drug allergy for its testing)
* PatientSafety_v4.gomsl - model for testing of multiple Medications (models prescribe PRN medication for chart 1 perfectly)
* PatientSafety_v5.gomsl - model for bringing previous sub-models together. Aims to model scenario1 of the patient charts. 
* PatientSafety_v6.gomsl - model for testing various object shapes.
* PatientSafety_v7.gomsl - model for testing of medications, but where fields are labeled. 
* PatientSafety_v8.gomsl - leading towards a proper user model for PRN medications, which can be compared against the empirical results. 
* PatientSafety_v9.gomsl - Trying to simplyfy the actions of the modelled user in version 8.
